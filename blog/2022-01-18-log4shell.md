## A Brief Introduction To Log4Shell

(What is Log4Shell, what makes it special (the fact that in our case, it applies to both our own infrastructure and the code we produce).)

## Finding Affected Infrastructure
(High-level intro to the fact that this part will be about network scanning, finding Log4J in our infrastructure, Log4J on your toaster, etc.)

### Finding Hosts
(Scanning subnets, amass on subdomains, etc.)

### Testing For Vulnerabilities
(Hitting things and seeing if they twitch)

### Building A Demo Target
(Needed to validate that our scanners work, luckily SCB makes it easy to add a new Demo target - briefly explain the process for this.)

### Putting It All Together
(If there is enough complexity to the final setup, reiterate it here, otherwise drop this part)


## Finding Affected Code
(As a software company, we not only have our own infrastructure, but we are also producing code that we need to check for vulnerabilities. We have already described how to do this in a previous blogpost, in this case we used rules developed by Kurt Boberg and shared on the semgrep slack. I'm not sure we actually need to go into great detail since it is pretty much identical to the previous blog post about SAST, so we may only need to highlight the differences if there are any, and I don't think there are.)

## Conclusion

(Conclusion goes here.)
We are looking forward to hearing your own stories and ideas for using secureCodeBox - [find us on Slack][scb-slack] or [GitHub][scb-repo] to get in touch.
