title: "Architecture Building Block View"
sidebar_label: "Building Block View"
---

Below, an overview is given of the global design/architecture of secureCodeBox. This document is inspired by the [C4](https://c4model.com/) model for visualizing software architecture. Conform this model, this document is split in 4 parts (i.e. levels). First, a `context` level overview, displaying the context in which the application is used. The second level, `containers`, broadly describes the different data streams. The third level consists of a `components` overview, describing the different (Django) apps and the interactions between them. The fourth and final level contains a `code` overview. Which will consist of class- and database-diagrams.
