# System Scope and Context {#section-system-scope-and-context}

SCB is an orchestration platform managing scan jobs and parsing results. The aim of this project is to make automated vulnerability scanning easy and efficient. The diagrams below, illustrate the external factors and the context in which SCB is used.

SCB only manages the scan tasks. The scanning functionality itself is considered out of scope and for this, third-party software is used.
