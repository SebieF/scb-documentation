This document describes the secureCodeBox Project (SCB) and is based on the [arc42](https://arc42.org/overview/) architecture documentation template. SecureCodeBox is a Kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project. Its goal is to orchestrate and easily automate a bunch of security-testing tools out of the box. With secureCodeBox we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.
