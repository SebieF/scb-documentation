# Architecture Decisions {#section-design-decisions}

We use _architecture decission records (ADR)_ to [document our architecture decissions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). We adopted the [template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md) from [Joel Parker Henderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson).

You find all ADRs in the sitebar section. They are numbered and ordered in their time of emergence.
